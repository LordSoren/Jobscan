# Jobscan

This program helps job seekers tailor their resume by identifying qualifications, skills, and keywords relevant to a particular position. The program then indicates whether those keywords already exist in the applicant's resume or not. This optimization increases the applicant's visibility to the recruiter and improves the chance of getting an interview. Without customizing resumes for each job posting, qualified candidates may go unnoticed. 

Jobscan (jobscan.co) helps applicants analyze their resume "for formatting errors, key qualifications, hard skills, best practices, word count, tone, and more" to boost their chances of landing an interview. However, without paying for the service the website only allows a limited number of free "scans" per month. Therefore, this program imitates some of the same features that JobScan offers by matching keywords and identifying key word counts from job listings.

This program needs:
1. The description from a job posting
2. Your resume
